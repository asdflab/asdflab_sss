asdflab_sss_agent is a framework for performing snapshots of diverse system states.

The actual system and state to snapshot is defined by sub-modules, thereby facillitating extensions and customizations.

The framework defines a common structure for registering, scheduling, logging, and storing the snapshot-data.

Contents of a snapshot is stored in a "continiously differential" way, meaning that each invocation registers
what changed since last time. This may be compared to one of the typical strategies for 
backup-applications: Differential (another being Full+Incremental)

Snapshot-data is split into two parts:
- The information common to all types of snapshots: Where and When wax X ssen, and the identity-info on X
  This information is stored alongside framework data in a database
- All other information, which can include large bulks of data
  Storage must be handled by the sub-module defining the snapshot. It can be database, files, or whatever needed.

Actually executing a snapshot is accompliced in three ways:
- Manually perform a snapshot from the commandline
- Executing a snapshot using a local scheduler like cron
- Act as a deamon, and look for scheduling events in a central database
