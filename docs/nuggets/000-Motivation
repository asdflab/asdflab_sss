A System State Snapshot is a picture, of how a set of dynamic states of a system looked like, at a certain point in time.
Using this snapshot, the System's state at that time can be stored for investigation, change-tracking, and even restoration.

The Author has been using this technique for tracking changes for such diverse tings as:
- The files present in a folder
- The messages present in an imap-account
- The actual usage of IP-addresses in an address-scope
- The existence and placement of virtual machines in a cluster

Other ideas for use of this system:
- Backup of configuration of network devices
- Tracking changes of routes through the Internet


This project is the Authors endavour to formalize these techniques into an extensible framework for easy deployment of snapshot functionality.
The project focuses on delivering the framework around the actual code to retrieve the information, and leave the retrieval code to be implemented by other developers.
That said, this project still delivers some retrieval modules, that can be used as-is, or serve as an example for other implementations.
