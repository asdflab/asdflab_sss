This project is divided into four parts:
- The Agent: A modularized framework for handling the invocation and metadata-storage of the snapshots
- The modules: Extension modules for the agent-framework for things such as retrieving state-information and storing bulk-data
- The Scheduler: An application that keeps time and tells agents when to perform snapshots
- The WebUI: A simplified, quick-start, web-application to manage schedules, logs, and snapshots

The project uses a (one or more) database for storing administrative data and snapshot metadata.
If bulk storage of data is needed for a snapshot, each snapshot-module can implement its own storage or use one of the frameworks storage-modules.
